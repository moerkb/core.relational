QUESTIONS
- empty intersect / not -> universal relation -> how to represent?
- another implementation for wrap? - ?
- (empty? rel) - empty for TABLE_DEE or TABLE_DUM
- When is a relation empty?

TASKS
- TABLE_DEE, TABLE_DUM
- restrict functions: fn, list and special macro
- saving relations (EDN, serialization)
- extensible reader (ex. UUID) for relations?
- order by - [attr asc/desc] and own comp fn (relation w/sorted set)
- standard functions for relations: contains?, count, reduce, ...

- make (:attr r) return a set
- project produces lazyseq? (SAP04)
- rename new-relation and create-relation to newrel
- tclose with two attributes and automatic projection
- relation.equals - trivial case number of tuples

NOTES
- TABLE_DEE, TABLE_DUM - true, false - empty tuple, empty set - SQL: extists
- semi join as single operator? -no
- join with joining attributes? -no
