QUESTIONS
- empty intersect / not -> universal relation -> how to represent?
- another implementation for wrap? - ?
- (empty? rel) - empty for TABLE_DEE or TABLE_DUM
- When is a relation empty?

- sequence order?
- one chapter for three pages?
- Why (:head r) and (:body r)?
- Tclose - state attributes?
- DEE/DUM example
- operators produce lazy sequences
- vectors instead of hash maps: better?
- restrict tuple functions: how to get (:attr t)? (SAP11b)

TASKS
- restrict functions: fn, list and special macro
- saving relvars and databases
- order by - [attr asc/desc] and own comp fn (relation w/sorted set)
- test data
- relvars

NOTES
- TABLE_DEE, TABLE_DUM - true, false - empty tuple, empty set - SQL: exists
