QUESTIONS
- empty intersect / not -> universal relation -> how to represent?
- another implementation for wrap? - ?
- (empty? rel) - empty for TABLE_DEE or TABLE_DUM

TASKS
- TABLE_DEE, TABLE_DUM
- restrict functions: fn, list and special macro
- saving relations (EDN, serialization)
- extensible reader (ex. UUID) for relations?
- join: just one case
- order by (sorted set, return on (seq r))
- standard functions for relations: contains?, count, reduce, ...
- construct test data
- better join algorithm
- summarize
- divide
- tclose
- SAP08: pretty printer fix
- SAP09: nil

NOTES
- TABLE_DEE, TABLE_DUM - true, false - empty tuple, empty set - SQL: extists
- semi join as single operator? -no
- join with joining attributes? -no
