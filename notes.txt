QUESTIONS
- empty intersect / not -> universal relation -> how to represent?
- natural join: [id name] join [id phone] - one id occurs more than once in one relation?
- TABLE_DEE?
- semi join as single operator?
- join with joining attributes?
- (vals ...) and (keys ...) retain the same order?
- name for extend?
- same hash code for equivalent relations (relation in relation, group)

TASKS
- saving relations (EDN, serialization)
- extensible reader (ex. UUID) for relations?
- join: just one case
- order by (sorted set, return on (seq r))
- standard functions for relations: contains?, count, reduce, ...
- special function/macro for project predicate (save source in meta, no %)
- construct test data
- better join algorithm
